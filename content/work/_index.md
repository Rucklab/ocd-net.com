# Module 1: Introduction to the treatment

Welcome to the first module of the study on internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In this first module, you'll read about cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), OCD, and we will introduce the treatment.

# Overview of the treatment plan

The treatment you'll undergo consists of 10 modules in total. Each module consists of a text section, questions relating to each module, and homework tasks. You will be working through these modules, in order, over the next 10 weeks. When you have completed the homework tasks and answered the questions for each module, you will be granted access to the next module, by your therapist.

## Modules 1-4: Learning about your OCD

The first four modules consist of an introduction to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and information about OCD. Here you'll read about how thoughts, behaviour, and distress relate to one another and why your obsessions and compulsions don't go away on their own. In this phase of the treatment you'll  create goals for yourself, and learn how exposure and response prevention, a specific form of CBT, can help you attain these goals.

A major focus of modules 1-4 is having you begin to analyse and describe your OCD. One of your main jobs in this phase will be to keep a journal to monitor how your obsessions and compulsions affect your daily life and which compulsions you get stuck in. This will guide your treatment in the next modules. It will also help your therapist personalise the treatment for you.

You will decide the pace at which you'll work with each module, but the work should not take more than a week per module. We prefer that you complete modules 1-4 within 2-3 weeks.

## Modules 5-10: Exposure and Ritual Prevention

In modules 5-10, you'll begin the most important part of the treatment for OCD: exposure and ritual prevention. Exposure involves practice confronting situations and thoughts that cause distress. Ritual prevention means blocking the behaviour that relieves the anxiety in the short-term, but which ends up maintaining OCD over the long term. Basically, you'll learn to handle situations you experience as distressing without having to rely on rituals (compulsions). This will be done gradually, starting with situations that are the least anxiety-provoking and then challenging your OCD at higher levels. With practice and repetition, you'll learn that the situations you fear and get stuck in aren't actually as pressing and dangerous as it seems. You'll also learn that you can tolerate distress without resorting to compulsions.

In the last module, you'll work on strategies for maintaining all the progress you've made in the future.

## Your therapist

Throughout the 10-week course of the treatment, you will be in contact with your therapist, who will support you by giving you feedback on your completed homework tasks, responding to your questions, troubleshooting, and offering suggestions and guidance to help resolve problems that arise in response to triggering situations.

You can contact your therapist under the menu selection "messages". An envelope icon that appears on the menu selection indicates that you have an unread message from your therapist.

Remember this is a guided self-help program where you are expected to take responsibility for reading all the texts carefully, and following the treatment as best you can. Your therapist is there to help you along the way, but you'll have to put hard work into this treatment if you want to get better. Believe that you are capable.

## Worksheets

As part of your treatment, we will ask you to fill out various worksheets throughout the course of the treatment. All worksheets will have instructions that explain how to use them, but you should contact your therapist if you have any questions.

It is very important to make use of the worksheets over the whole course of the treatment as they help your therapist better understand your OCD and tailor your treatment. With the data the worksheets provide, your therapist can keep track of how the treatment is progressing for you and work to solve any problems that come up along the way.

# What is CBT?

Cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, is an evidence-based psychological treatment that teaches skills to address problematic current thoughts and behaviours in daily life. CBT is a present-focused therapy, which means we work on patterns of thoughts and behaviours. Does that mean your early years and previous experiences are of no interest in CBT? A medical example might help illustrate the CBT approach to this question:

> A patient went to the doctor due to high cholesterol which was caused by years of poor eating habits and not enough exercise. Those past behaviours may have lead to the problem, but they can't be undone: it's impossible to un-eat that gravy from last year, or that bag of chips from yesterday. So while past behaviours may have led to the problem, it's only in the present that this patient can act to start lowering cholesterol by eating better and getting more exercise.

The same applies to how we think in CBT: your problems arose through your previous experiences, and nobody can change those. On the other hand, you can try to change what you think and do (or don't think and do) today. However, prior experiences can provide important information on the problems you're currently experiencing. Perhaps the patient in our example above tried to alter his/her diet previously, but didn't succeed. Experiences like the one described above are to be taken into consideration, since they can help inform your treatment.

## Setting goals for treatment

In CBT treatment, it is important to establish clearly stated goals. These goals are built not only on what you as the patient want, but also incorporate practical and helpful strategies that have proven effective within CBT treatment. Realistic, clear goals will help both you and your therapist know where you're going and how far you've come. Setting goals specific to you is something that you'll address with your therapist in the upcoming modules.

## Taking an active role in your treatment

CBT requires patients to play an active role in getting better. In this treatment, you'll learn how you can look at your problems from a CBT perspective, and you'll also learn how you can handle intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviours in new ways, so that they no longer dominate your life. However, no one can change your thoughts and behaviours for you, only you can do that. This is why you will manage most of the work to change your behaviour on your own. We'll be beside you to support you in your work.

The homework tasks are the most important part of CBT, and you'll work on them each week. Doing these tasks is the most important part of a successful treatment. These exercises also set you up for being able to maintain an-OCD free life even after the treatment is completed.

Does what we're describing sound like a lot of work? It is! However, keep in mind that this treatment is only a very small part of your life. You'll be working around 6-7 hours a week for 12 weeks. Compare that with all the years of distress and avoidance that you've already experienced and can expect in the future if you don't work on these issues now. Consider this treatment an intensive investment of time in the short term and a really good investment in the long term, so that you may live a fuller, freer life. Specifically, research has shown that using CBT for OCD during a shorter and more intensive time period yields better results. Remember that you're not on your own in the treatment, and your therapist is here to support you.

It's not always easy to work on changing your behaviour, especially not when it means exposing yourself to situations that provoke distress. When it feels like things are extra hard during treatment, sometimes people feel like withdrawing from treatment , stop writing to their therapist, and stop reading the modules. We want to urge you instead to have extra close contact with your therapist when it's toughest in the treatment.

# What is Obsessive-compulsive Disorder?

Suffering from OCD means you have obsessions and engage in compulsions. We've tried to be very sparing with technical words in this treatment. Two important concepts that are important for you, however, are "obsessions" and "compulsions".                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

**Obsession** is an umbrella term for unpleasant thoughts,       images, or impulses that cause distress. Note that obsessions are a broad concept. They could be images, numbers, melodies, impulses, feelings of insecurity, or clear thoughts that upset you. Any of these may cause you significant distress. Distress is also a broad term. Some people with OCD experience anxiety as a result of their obsessions and fear that terrible events will occur. Others report that their distress is more focused on feeling disgusted and grossed out by a variety of factors within yourself or your environment. Still others have the sense that something isn't right, along with feelings of tension that their fear will only build over time until a compulsion is performed.

**Compulsions** are what you've probably been doing to temporarily calm the distress. Compulsions can be almost any behaviour (sometimes even thoughts that you might call upon) that may make you feel more immediately comfortable, but get in the way of you tackling and beating your OCD.

Remember and review these definitions, as they are the basis for what we'll work on throughout the entire treatment.
                                                                              
## Obsessions

As we mentioned previously, obsessive-compulsive disorder means that you have intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses that lead to distress:

![](static/work/M1_1.png)

Obsessions can be thoughts, images or doubts that:
1) You don't want (intrusive).  
2) You usually try to ignore, push away, or minimize.  
3) Cause you distress.  
4) Keep coming back, even when you resist having them.  

Below are a few examples of different types of obsessions, organized by some common OCD themes.

| **Type of obsession** | **Example**  |
| :------ | :------ |
| Responsibility for causing injury or making mistakes  | Thought that I may have dropped a pill on the floor and a child will swallow it and die |
|  | Concern that something could go wrong because the books aren't symmetrical on the shelf |
|  | Thoughts that I'll be responsible for starting a fire by leaving the oven on |
|  | Doubts that I might have hit someone with my car and didn't notice |
|  | Feeling as though the number 13 could cause bad luck for someone I love |
| Excessive concern with dirt, bacteria, illnesses, poison, and nausea | Thought that I will become ill by contracting bacteria from a public toilet |
|  | Concern that the chemicals under the sink may cause me to get sick |
|  | Feeling extremely grossed out and disgusted by finding hairs in the bathroom sink, and feeling like you will vomit |
| Order and symmetry | Need to keep your desk perfectly arranged |
|  | Feeling like things need to be done in sets (such as odd or even numbers) in order to feel complete |
|  | Thoughts or an impulse that it has to "feel just right" when doing a mundane activity (such as placing down your toothbrush in a particular way) |
| Obsessions about violence, sex, morality, and religion | Unwanted impulse to push a stranger into traffic while walking on the street |
|  | Horrific images about hurting or killing someone I love |
|  | Blasphemous thoughts or images (thinking "God is dead") |
|  | The impulse to stare at someone's genitals |
|  | Concerns that you might behave in a horrible way (to such asking yourself "what if I become a pedophile?") |
|  | Ideas about inappropriate sexual relations |
|  | Unwanted thoughts about Jesus on the cross with an erection |

Note that you can have obsessions about anything at all. Sometimes the contents of obsessions are not reasonable or even physically possible. Your symptoms might not neatly fit into any of the categories above, and that is okay. This treatment is structured for all types of OCD symptoms; together with your therapist, you'll learn how best to organize and understand your symptoms.

It's also important to remember that obsessions often become so automatic that you don't notice them or you may have gotten so good at avoiding situations that trigger obsessions that they don't happen too often. It might be hard to recognize your obsessions at first. Have patience, we'll get back to this in the coming modules!

## Compulsions

As we mentioned earlier, compulsions have the function of reducing the distress that comes with obsessions:

![](static/work/M1_2.png)

Compulsions are everything you do to relieve or neutralize the distress and anxiety that comes with obsessions. Compulsions may bring relief, but it is only temporary. As a result, you may find yourself having to do more and more compulsions over time. In this way compulsions can become so time consuming that they begin to interfere with your life as they disrupt your ability to do things you'd like to be doing (working, seeing friends). Sometimes people will change their behaviours so they can avoid situations that would provoke obsessions and urges to do compulsions. This can also interfere with your life in important ways.

Compulsions and avoidance behaviours tend to grow over time, so that they take more and more energy and time. Once you've been performing compulsions for years it can be hard to change your patterns of behaviour. But don't worry, that's what this treatment is all about.

There are four main types of compulsions:
1) Behaviours that you do by yourself  
2) Behaviours that you do that also involve other people  
3) Mental compulsions  
4) Avoidance  

Below are a few examples:

| **Type of compulsion** | **Example** |
| :------ | :------ |
| Behaviours that you do by yourself | Repeatedly washing your hands |
|  | Repeatedly checking the stove to be sure it's off |
|  | Flipping the light switch four times |
|  | Checking every four minutes to make sure your child is breathing and hasn't died of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) |
| Behaviours that involve other people (reassurance seeking) | Asking my partner if the stove really is off |
|  | Calling my co-worker and asking if she really got the letter I sent |
|  | Repeatedly asking my paster if he believes God will be angry because I didn't live up to his commandments |
| Mental compulsions | Thinking through, in detail, if I really shut the stove off |
|  | Calling up a "good" image to counteract a "bad" image (e.g., neutralizing an image of suffocating my child by imagining hugging my child) |
|  | Repetitive prayers designed to neutralize a thought ("I would never hurt anyone. I would never hurt anyone") |
|  | Avoiding children out of fear I might be violent towards them |
|  | Avoiding "dirty" restaurants that I feel will make me sick |
|  | Avoiding using the oven so I won't be responsible if it causes a fire |
|  | Avoiding the subway so I won't act on an impulse to push someone onto the tracks |

As you see, compulsions—just like obsessions—can vary a great deal. This means your problems can be totally different from the problems other patients with OCD have. This is, however, no obstacle to helping you in particular. The CBT model for OCD has components that apply to anyone affected.

## Distress can consist of many different feelings

Not everyone with OCD experiences the same types of distress and anxiety. Some people have catastrophic thoughts, for example thinking about the house burning down or that they will become pedophiles. These terrible possibilities (however unlikely they are to come true) provoke anxiety. Other people with OCD report that they aren't afraid of something in particular that will happen, they just feel grossed out and disgusted by certain triggers (e.g., eating certain foods, touching "dirty" objects). Others have more subtle, unpleasant thoughts that "something is not quite right". They may feel as if they will not ever feel normal again until they are able to do things perfectly or just so.

*Regardless of the subject, OCD consists of obsessions that cause distress. To reduce the distress, you turn to compulsions.*

# Kristen, Matt, Joan and Steve: Four examples of OCD

Now we'd like to introduce you to four different people: Kristen, Matt, Joan and Steve.  They represent a few common types of OCD symptoms and will serve as examples throughout the entire treatment program. In this module, you'll read through the problems of all four to determine which one is most similar to the OCD issues you struggle with. In the following modules, you'll click on a link for the person you think is most relevant for your problems; however you can read about each one.

## Kristen

Kristen is leaving her house one morning on the way to work. Just after she's left her doorstep the thought pops into her head, Did I really lock the door?  Having this thought leaves her uncertain about whether to door is really locked, making her feel anxious and uncomfortable. So, just to be sure, she walks back to the door to check the lock. When she sees that it is really locked she feels immediately relieved and her anxiety drops immediately. She's just created a pattern: any feelings of doubt and uncertainty about the door being locked are quickly relieved by checking. However, she soon finds that even after checking once, some doubt remains. She thinks "what if I made a mistake when I was checking? I could have been distracted. I should check again just to be ABSOLUTELY sure." The next time Kristen leaves her apartment, checking the lock once isn't enough to set her mind at ease, so she starts checking twice.  After having done that for a while, she finds that there is still some doubt and uncertainty as to whether the door is really locked, even after checking twice. This cycle can continue to grow until she is checking three or more times, or even engaging in other behaviours to reduce her uncertainty about the locks. For example, she might start making sure that she's not the last one to leave the house, in effect assigning responsibility for locking the door to her husband.

## Steve

Steve is washing his hands after having gone to the bathroom. Suddenly he has an intrusive thought: Did I really wash my hands properly? This thought is distressing, and makes him feel in danger of getting sick. Just to be safe, he washes his hands again. He feels much safer and is once again calm. Without thinking more about it, Steve's "alarm system" has just learned that the more you wash your hands, the less likely it is you'll get sick, and the more comfortable you'll feel. Whereas at first washing his hands once or twice might have been enough to make Steve feel relieved, over time he feels compelled to wash more and more.

## Joan

Joan has just cleaned the living room and feels satisfied that it is clean and tidy. But there's something that bothers her: the books on the shelf are not in a correct order. She begins to get a feeling, something is not right. To reduce this feeling of distress, she lines the books up just right. She is calm again. She doesn't notice it, but her brain is learning whenever things don't feel right, re-arrange things until they do and you'll feel better. The next time Joan cleans the living room, it is likely that she will not be satisfied with the way it is arranged and she will start organizing and arranging things very carefully. After having cleaned this way for a while, she also might start to get the not-just-right feeling when she thinks about the organization of her refrigerator. Her compulsions could soon spread so that she also feels compelled to organize her fridge just right.

## Matt

Matt is visiting his relatives. His sister's children, who are both two years old, are running naked through a sprinkler in the yard. While sitting on the balcony with the others, he looks down for a moment, notices the children and suddenly has an intrusive thought: What if I'm a pedophile? This thought causes terrible feelings of anxiety and distress. To stop these thoughts, he goes into the house where he won't be able to see the children naked and also mentally reassures himself that he would never do anything inappropriate with a child. The anxiety quickly disappears and he becomes calm again. Matt's alarm system has just learned: being around children makes me feel anxious, avoiding kids and reassuring myself that I'm not a pedophile makes me feel relieved.

One week later, Matt goes to the YMCA to swim in the pool. When he goes into the locker room to change, he realizes that there are children also getting changed in there. The distressing thought that he might be a pedophile returns. Since he was able to calm himself by avoiding the situation last time, he quickly exits the locker room and returns home without swimming in the pool. The next time he is invited to visit his sister's family, Matt decides to decline the invitation to prevent himself from experiencing the thoughts that he may be a pedophile.

Kristen, Matt, Joan and Steve in the examples above all suffer from OCD, but the symptoms express themselves differently. Despite the fact that OCD can look quite different from person to person, you can see a common pattern.  People with OCD have thoughts, images, and/or impulses that arouse distress (obsessions). They then do something to reduce the distress (compulsions).

# Other information about OCD

## How common is OCD?

Research has shown that between 2-3% of the population develops obsessive-compulsive disorder. This would mean that more than 6 million Americans living today risk suffering from OCD at some point during their lifetime. Most develop OCD in their teenage years or early adulthood. Only one-fifth of those who have obsessive-compulsive disorder develop it after age 35.

While only 2-3% of the population has OCD, most people have thoughts similar to yours. It's entirely normal to have unpleasant thoughts, images, or impulses that cause distress. In modules 2 and 3, we'll present a more in-depth model that explains why some of these develop into OCD.

## Why does OCD set in?

Research suggests that OCD arises through the interplay of genetics and environment. The conditions you grew up in and certain genes may both serve as contributing factors for developing OCD. However, knowing an exact cause is not necessary for implementing a successful treatment. For example, a doctor who sees a patient with a broken arm is not especially concerned about determining the exact cause of the fracture. It could have been broken falling out of a tree house or in a car accident. Either way, the doctor will be able to set the arm and put a cast on it. Similarly, for the purposes of this treatment, we focus much more on the "here and now": helping you improve your day to day life, rather than trying to identify the precise cause of your OCD in the first place.

## Introduction to the OCD diary

The OCD diary is a worksheet you will fill in every day for the duration of the treatment. You and your therapist will use it together to get a better, clearer picture of what your symptoms in particular look like. The first few weeks will consist of writing down entries.

Our experience has been that many patients sometimes think along the lines of: "Can't we skip these unnecessary preparations and just START?" Having these thoughts in the first few weeks is completely normal. Here, we're asking you to trust our experience in treating OCD. Filling in the OCD diary is crucial for being able to plan your treatment.

As we mentioned earlier, people with OCD can have quite different behaviours as a consequence of their compulsions. That's why there is no ready-made template that fits everyone; you'll make your own.

During your work with the OCD diary, it's important to remember that this is a time-limited therapy and will not go on forever. Therefore, put your best possible effort into it. If you run into any problems, don't forget to contact your therapist for help.

Also, remember that it's always better to write too much than too little when you fill in your OCD diary. That makes it easier for both you and your therapist to really identify your problems.

## Get your family's help in self-monitoring!

OCD often negatively affects relationships with those near and dear to you. Frequently, family and friends are affected and become part of the problem. Maybe you get help from someone you know if you're unsure whether you locked the door or if you really unplugged the toaster. Why is that? Well, probably because your friends or family members care about you and feel bad when they see you in distress. To make you feel better, they do their best to give you reassurances, or maybe even take over household tasks that cause you anxiety. Sometimes obsessions and compulsions can lead to frustration, bad moods, or arguments. How can your friend or family member help you in your treatment? As we mentioned earlier, many compulsions are almost automatic; people don't always think when they perform compulsions. Having a friend or family member as an extra observer can be worth a lot!

In your homework tasks on the next page, you will be asked to choose one or more persons who can support you and involve them in your treatment on an ongoing basis. For the first step, you can get help monitoring your symptoms.

NOTE: Sometimes it's not possible to get a support person; it may also be that the people around you aren't that involved in your compulsions. If this is the case, there is no reason to believe that this treatment won't work as well for you. Having a support person is an extra asset, but it isn't necessary for you to feel the positive effects of this treatment.

Homework tasks, Module 1

After you fill in a worksheet, it's very important to remember to click "Save." Your therapist will review your diary entries and provide you with feedback along the way. Remember that everything doesn't need to be perfect the first time, but make your best effort.
