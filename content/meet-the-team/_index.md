OCD-NET is developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. OCD-NET has been evaluated in six clinical trials to date with results indicating that it is as effective as regular face-to-face CBT, while requiring less therapist time per patient and with the advantage of being accessible from any device connected to the internet (Andersson et al. 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015; Rück et al. 2018). The treatment was initially developed in Swedish but has been translated to English and evaluated in a pilot study in New York (Patel et al. (2017)). OCD-NET has also been translated to Portuguese and is currently being evaluated in Brazil.

The researchers involved in OCD-NET are **Oskar Flygare**, Lic. Psychologist and PhD Student; **Christian Rück**, MD, PhD, Associate Professor; **Erik Andersson**, Lic. Psychologist, PhD; and **Brjánn Ljótsson**, Lic. Psychologist, PhD, Associate Professor. You can read more about the research team at [https://www.rucklab.com](https://www.rucklab.com).
