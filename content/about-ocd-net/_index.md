Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD-NET) is a therapist-guided self-help programme divided into 10 parts (modules). Each module consists of text with information, as well as homework assignments and exercises to complete. This treatment requires that you actively engage with the material and are willing to try exercises from the treatment on your own. We also recommend that you put aside one hour per day to spend on the treatment in order to fully benefit from OCD-NET.

Treatment with OCD-NET lasts 10 weeks and you will be in contact with a therapist on the platform throughout treatment. You communicate by sending messages to each other (very similar to e-mail or SMS messages). Your therapist will support you, answer questions, and give feedback on exercises. Because the treatment is delivered remotely, you are able to get rapid feedback on the exercises instead of having to wait for the next appointment. You are encouraged to message your therapist as soon as questions or difficulties arise.

### Modules 1-4: Learning about your OCD

The first four modules consist of an introduction to cognitive behavioural therapy and information about OCD. Here you'll read about how thoughts, behaviour, and distress relate to one another and why your obsessions and compulsions don't go away on their own. In this phase of the treatment you'llÂ  create goals for yourself, and learn how exposure and ritual prevention can help you attain these goals. [The first module is available on this site](http://www.ocd-net.com/explore/).

### Modules 5-10: Exposure and Ritual Prevention

In modules 5-10, you'll begin the most important part of the treatment for OCD: exposure and ritual prevention. You'll learn to handle situations you experience as distressing without having to rely on rituals (compulsions). This will be done gradually, starting with situations that are the least anxiety-provoking and then challenging your OCD at higher levels. With practice and repetition, you'll learn that the situations you fear and get stuck in aren't actually as pressing and dangerous as it seems. You'll also learn that you can tolerate distress without resorting to compulsions.

Here's a short video where you can see the patient interface and the features of OCD-NET.
