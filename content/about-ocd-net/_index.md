# How does it work?

<ul>
    <li>You access OCD-NET from a web browser</li>
    <li>The platform contains reading material, worksheets and homework assignments</li>
    <li>You communicate with your therapist through a built-in message system (similar to text messages or e-mail)</li>
    <li>Your therapist reads and responds to messages every weekday</li>
</ul>

# What is OCD-NET?

<ul>
    <li>OCD-NET is a therapist-guided treatment, meaning that you receive guidance from a therapist, but where you complete exercises and homework assignments on your own</li>
    <li>Treatment lasts 10 weeks</li>
    <li>The treatment is based on cognitive behaviour therapy, and contains the same elements that you would encounter in a regular face-to-face treatment</li>
</ul>

## Overview of treatment

Here's an overview of the different parts (modules) of OCD-NET.

### Modules 1-4: Learning about your OCD

The first four modules consist of an introduction to cognitive behavioural therapy and information about OCD. Here you'll read about how thoughts, behaviour, and distress relate to one another and why your obsessions and compulsions don't go away on their own. In this phase of the treatment you'llÂ  create goals for yourself, and learn how exposure and ritual prevention can help you attain these goals. [The first module is available on this site](http://www.ocd-net.com/explore/).

### Modules 5-10: Exposure and Ritual Prevention

In modules 5-10, you'll begin the most important part of the treatment for OCD: exposure and ritual prevention. You'll learn to handle situations you experience as distressing without having to rely on rituals (compulsions). This will be done gradually, starting with situations that are the least anxiety-provoking and then challenging your OCD at higher levels. With practice and repetition, you'll learn that the situations you fear and get stuck in aren't actually as pressing and dangerous as it seems. You'll also learn that you can tolerate distress without resorting to compulsions.

Here's a short video where you can see the patient interface and the features of OCD-NET.
