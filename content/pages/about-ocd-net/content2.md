## What is OCD-NET?

OCD-NET is a therapist-guided treatment, meaning that you receive guidance from a therapist, but complete exercises and homework assignments on your own. Treatment lasts 10 weeks and is based on cognitive behaviour therapy. OCD-nET contains the same elements that you would encounter in a regular face-to-face treatment.
